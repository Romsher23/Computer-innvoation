<p class="outset"> Computer vision is basically an artificial intelligence that programs the computer to interpret what it sees and pulls up an google image of the object that it scanned.<P class="outset"> It uses digital images that it takes from cameras and sensors with very complex algorithms  and machines to identify the object correctly.<P class="outset"> After that, it uses google search engine to find that same picture online. However, the other goal for computer vision is to extract information from the object or describe what they see in the image.<p class="outset"> There are many ways this innovation can impact our society but one of them i want to touch on is the medical. This new technology can be used as a scanner to describe what they see inside the human body and what shouldn't be in the human like a tumor, cancer, etc… This helps doctors diagnose patients faster and efficiently with all the knowledge they gather on the person. </p>
