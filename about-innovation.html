<p><b>How computer vision works is they take a very expensive camera that also has sensors built in and they use it to scan the object that they want. Then that image goes through a very complex algorithm that finds the image online in google images. This innovation can also be used to find processing, analyzing, and understanding images and, in general, high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical and symbolic information about the item. This machine also helps to find the edges in an image. It is a higher level of image processing where the input is an image and the output is not an image, but an description of the image.
    <P>One way that computer vision can impact our lives is new healthcare. Back then technology was in its early days with medicine and now we have changed it for the better. Computer vision can help doctors find hidden problems with the human body and it can also help diagnose the patient faster. However, One negative effect it has is  the Potential to identify theft, discrimination based on identity, identity error and misinformation, espionage and copy right infringement. </b>
